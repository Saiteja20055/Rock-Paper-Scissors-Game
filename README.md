# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This project is a web-based game where a user can play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent. The primary goal is to provide a complete, functional, and visually appealing game that demonstrates core front-end development skills. It tracks scores, manages game rounds, and saves a history of past matches for the player to review.
